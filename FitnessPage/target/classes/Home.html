                    Welcome to my Fitness Journey! Fitness is not about being better than someone else. It's about being better than you used to be.Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't.Fitness is not about being better than someone else. It's about being better than you used to be.Your body can stand almost anything. It's your mind that you have to convince.Fitness is like a relationship. You can't cheat and expect it to work.Fitness is not a destination, it's a way of life.
